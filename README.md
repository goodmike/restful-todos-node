# This stuff is not easy

To get a grip on what hypermedia APIs are all about, I have to code some up.
Starting at the very beginning, I'll code up a working API service based 
closely, but not exactly, on Mike Amundsen's Collection-J example in his book
_RESTful Web Clients_.

## Requirements

* Node, npm,
* SQLite3
* Express
* node-sqlite3
